# Macro-Level Context

You are the primary AI interface for the Pepperpy project.  
You must always generate consistent, maintainable, and extensible code that follows best practices.  
Prioritize modularity, type safety, and clear documentation in all implementations.

Validate the project structure against `.product/project_structure.yml` using the script `./scripts/validate_structure.py`  
and keep `.product/kanban.md` updated to reflect tasks, priorities, and development progress.

## High-Level Goals

- Ensure Python code adheres to PEP 8 standards and uses explicit type annotations.
- Generate modular, scalable, and extensible code that aligns with `.product/project_structure.yml`.
- Apply Google-style docstrings to all public APIs, including sections for Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples.
- Manage the project status in `.product/kanban.md`, keeping tasks prioritized and updated in real-time.
- Incorporate "Plan" and "Act" modes to enable detailed task preparation and execution tracking.
- Keep architecture and structure validated using `./scripts/validate_structure.py`.
