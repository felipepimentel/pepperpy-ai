# PepperPy Rules Management and Evolution

## Overview

This document defines standards for creating, organizing, and maintaining Cursor rules for the PepperPy framework, including processes for rule evolution and auto-correction when failures are identified. These rules ensure that AI tools have consistent, up-to-date information about the project structure, coding standards, and implementation patterns.

## Rules System Architecture

The PepperPy rules system follows a hierarchical numbering convention:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── 000-framework-architecture.mdc    # Core framework architecture (highest priority)
├── 001-coding-standards.mdc          # General coding standards 
├── 002-file-management.mdc           # File organization and structure
├── ...
├── 100-rag-system.mdc                # Domain-specific: RAG
├── 101-workflow-system.mdc           # Domain-specific: Workflows
├── ...
├── 180-code-duplication-prevention.mdc # Code quality: Duplication prevention
├── 185-file-organization.mdc         # Code quality: File organization
├── 190-api-evolution.mdc             # Code quality: API evolution
├── 195-ai-response-validation.mdc    # Code quality: AI validation
├── ...
├── 200-rules-management.mdc          # Meta: Rules management (this file)
├── ...
├── auto-generated/                   # Auto-generated rules
│   ├── module-map.mdc                # Generated module map
│   ├── class-hierarchy.mdc           # Generated class hierarchy
│   └── ...
```

### Rule Categories

1. **000-099**: Core framework rules
   - Architecture, standards, and general principles
   - Highest priority and broadest application

2. **100-199**: Domain-specific rules
   - Rules for specific domains (RAG, workflows, etc.)
   - Applied to specific subsets of the codebase

3. **180-199**: Code quality rules
   - Specific code quality concerns
   - Applied across the codebase

4. **200-299**: Meta rules
   - Rules about rules
   - Self-management and update mechanisms

## Rule Structure

Each rule file must follow this structure with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Rule Title
description: Brief description of the rule
globs: 
  - "Pattern matching files this rule applies to"
priority: 1000  # Numeric priority (higher values = higher priority)
---

# Rule Title

## Overview

Brief description of the rule's purpose and scope.

## Section 1

Content for section 1...

## Section 2

Content for section 2...

...

## Conclusion

Summary of the rule.
```

### Required Frontmatter Fields

- **title**: Concise title describing the rule
- **description**: Brief summary for rule selection UI
- **globs**: Pattern(s) matching files the rule applies to (as a YAML array)
- **priority**: Numeric priority value (higher = more important)

## Unified Tool for Rule Management

PepperPy adopts the principle of **single unified tool** for rule management:

- **All rule management operations** are implemented in the `refactor.py` script
- **No auxiliary scripts** should be created for related functions
- **Extensions happen via subcommands** in the main script

```bash
# Example usage
python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --help

# Available commands:
# --scan                  : Scan and update module mappings
# --validate              : Validate all rules
# --validate-frontmatter  : Verify YAML frontmatter format
# --generate              : Generate new rule from template
# --update                : Update existing rule
# --version               : Update versions and timestamps
# --analyze-coverage      : Analyze rule coverage
# --register-issue        : Register identified issue
# --verify                : Verify rule effectiveness
# --audit                 : Audit rule effectiveness
```

## Rule Creation Guidelines

When creating new rules:

1. **Use the correct numbering**: Follow the numbering convention for the appropriate category
2. **Set appropriate scope**: Use glob patterns to limit rule application to relevant files
3. **Include examples**: Provide clear code examples
4. **Keep focused**: Each rule should have a clear, specific purpose
5. **Avoid duplication**: Check for overlap with existing rules
6. **Include implementation patterns**: Show how to apply the rule in practice

### Example Rule Creation Workflow

1. Identify a need for a new rule
2. Determine the appropriate category
3. Find the next available number in that category
4. Create a file with the appropriate name (`NNN-descriptive-name.mdc`)
5. Include required frontmatter
6. Structure the content with clear sections
7. Add the rule to version control

## Rule Feedback and Evolution Process

### 1. Identifying Failures

When a failure in code generation is identified:

```bash
# Register the failure with details
python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --register-issue --rule 195 --description "Description of the failure" --example "Code with failure"
```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

Perform analysis to determine:
- Which rule should have prevented the problem
- Why the rule was insufficient
- How the rule can be improved

Use integrated analyses:

```bash
# Analyze rule coverage for the problem type
python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --analyze-coverage --issue-type "duplication"
```

### 3. Rule Updates

```bash
# Update the specific rule
python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --update --rule 195 --section "Common Scenarios" --add-example "new_example"
```

### 4. Improvement Validation

Verify that the updated rule prevents the original problem:

```bash
# Regression test to verify improvement
python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --verify --rule 195 --test-case "problem_case"
```

## Automatic Rule Maintenance

The system includes mechanisms for rule self-updating:

### Automatic Updates

Rules can be automatically generated or updated by:

1. **Module scanner**: Scans the codebase and updates module maps
2. **API analyzer**: Analyzes public APIs and updates interface documentation
3. **Dependency tracker**: Tracks third-party dependencies and updates compatibility info

### Scheduled Review Process

Schedule regular rule reviews:

```bash
# Generate rule effectiveness report
python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --audit --period "last-3-months"
```

Analyze:
1. Frequency of each failure type
2. Least effective rules
3. Emerging patterns not covered

## Process for Handling AI Errors

Process to follow when AI commits errors:

1. **Identify the error category**:
   - Incorrect project structure
   - API hallucination
   - Code duplication
   - API compatibility violation
   - Incorrect frontmatter format

2. **Locate the corresponding rule**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --find-rule --issue-type "hallucination"
   ```

3. **Register the issue**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --register-issue --rule 195 --description "AI generated non-existent import" --example "from pepperpy.nonexistent import Class"
   ```

4. **Update the rule with counter-example**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --update --rule 195 --section "Common Scenarios" --add-example "counter_example"
   ```

5. **Validate the updated rule**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/refactor.py rule-management --verify --rule 195
   ```

## Rule Usage Patterns

AI tools should use these rules as follows:

1. **Before creating new files**: Consult relevant structure and naming rules
2. **When writing code**: Follow coding standard rules
3. **When implementing components**: Use domain-specific pattern rules
4. **When refactoring**: Check impacts against architectural rules

### Pattern for Code Generation

When generating new code:

```
1. Identify the domain (e.g., RAG, LLM, Workflow)
2. Check domain-specific rules
3. Check file structure rules
4. Check coding standard rules
5. Generate code following all applicable rules
6. Validate against examples
```

### Pattern for Code Modification

When modifying existing code:

```
1. Identify the file's domain
2. Check domain-specific rules
3. Understand existing patterns in the file
4. Make changes respecting both the rules and existing patterns
5. Ensure backward compatibility if required
```

## Conclusion

The PepperPy rules system provides a comprehensive framework for guiding AI-assisted development. By following these standards for rule creation, organization, and updating, we ensure that AI tools have access to accurate, consistent information about the project. The self-correction mechanisms ensure the system evolves continuously, learning from failures to prevent future recurrences.
