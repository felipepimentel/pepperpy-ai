# Testing Guidelines

- Test against interface definitions, using **mocks** for external dependencies.
- Include **unit**, **integration**, and **lifecycle** tests.
- Validate **type annotations** within test cases.

**Example:**

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

def test_component_initialization():
    mock_dependency = Mock()
    component = MyComponent(dependency=mock_dependency)
    assert component.dependency is mock_dependency
```
