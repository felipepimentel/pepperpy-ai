# Examples Execution Guidelines

This document provides a straightforward approach to running the example Python scripts located in the `examples` directory using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## 1. Directory Structure

```plaintext
examples/
├── research_assistant.py
├── research_workflow.py
└── ...
```

- **basic_example.py**, **advanced_example.py**, etc.: Individual Python scripts demonstrating specific functionalities.  
- **pyproject.toml**: A Poetry configuration file listing the necessary dependencies for all scripts in the `examples` folder.

## 2. Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
   - This will create (or update) a virtual environment and install any packages specified in `pyproject.toml`.


2. **Navigate to the `examples` Folder**  
   ```bash
   cd examples
   ```


## 3. Running an Example

Inside the `examples` directory, you can execute any script by using `poetry run python`, followed by the script name. For example:

```bash
poetry run python research_assistant.py
```

## 4. Common Steps for Development

1. **Edit Scripts**  
   - Modify the `.py` files directly as needed.  
2. **Add Dependencies**  
   - If a new script needs additional libraries, update `pyproject.toml` accordingly.  
3. **Lock and Install**  
   - Run `poetry lock && poetry install` to ensure the dependency lockfile stays in sync.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Poetry Not Found**:  
  - Make sure Poetry is installed and available in your PATH. Refer to [Poetry’s official docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation steps.
- **Virtual Environment Conflicts**:  
  - Remove or deactivate any existing venv if you encounter conflicts. Then re-run `poetry install`.
- **Python Version**:  
  - Check that the Python version specified in `pyproject.toml` matches the one you have installed locally.
