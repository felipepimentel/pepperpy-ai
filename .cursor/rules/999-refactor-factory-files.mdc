# URGENT: Consolidate factory.py into base.py files

## Critical Instruction

PepperPy has determined that having separate factory.py files causes excessive fragmentation and violates the module organization principles. All factory.py files must be consolidated into their corresponding base.py files.

## Action Required

When you encounter any factory.py file:

1. Move the `create_provider` and any other factory functions to the corresponding module's base.py file
2. Update imports in __init__.py to import from base.py instead of factory.py
3. Delete the factory.py file
4. Update any import statements that reference the factory.py file

## Example Refactoring

From this structure:
```
module/
├── __init__.py
├── base.py
├── factory.py  # Contains create_provider function
└── providers/
```

To this structure:
```
module/
├── __init__.py  # import base.create_provider
├── base.py      # Contains interfaces AND create_provider function
└── providers/
```

## Implementation Steps

1. First check if a factory.py exists for the module you're working with
2. Read both the factory.py and base.py files
3. Move the functions from factory.py to base.py
4. Update __init__.py to import from base.py
5. Delete the factory.py file

## Import Statement Updates

Update imports from:
```python
from pepperpy.module.factory import create_provider
```

To:
```python
from pepperpy.module import create_provider
# or
from pepperpy.module.base import create_provider
```
