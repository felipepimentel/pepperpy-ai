# File Management Rules

## File Header Template
Every source file must start with a header comment following this template:
```python
"""
@file: {filename}
@purpose: Brief description of the file's purpose
@component: Which component this file belongs to
@created: YYYY-MM-DD
@task: TASK-XXX (if applicable)
@status: [active|deprecated|experimental]
"""
```

## Directory Structure Rules
1. Only create directories when needed by a task
2. Each directory must contain a `__init__.py` with its purpose
3. Keep directory depth <= 3 levels when possible
4. Use meaningful directory names that reflect component purpose

## Pre-File Creation Checks
Before creating a new file:
1. Check for similar files in the codebase
2. Verify the file follows naming conventions
3. Ensure the file has a clear single responsibility
4. Confirm the file location matches architecture

## File Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for Python files
- Test files prefix: `test_`
- Interface files prefix: `i_`
- Abstract base classes prefix: `abc_`
- Type definition files suffix: `_types`

## Structure Export Format
```plaintext
# Directory Structure Export Format
directory/              # Purpose: Brief description
├── subdirectory/      # Purpose: Brief description
│   └── file.py       # Purpose: Brief description
└── another_file.py   # Purpose: Brief description
```

## Structure Management Scripts
Location: `scripts/`
1. `export_structure.py`: Generates simplified structure overview
2. `validate_headers.py`: Validates file headers
3. `check_duplicates.py`: Checks for potential duplicate files

## Evolution Guidelines
1. Start with minimal structure required by current sprint
2. Add directories only when implementing related tasks
3. Keep `project_structure.yml` as source of truth
4. Update architecture diagrams with structural changes

## Integration with Task Workflow
1. Task planning must include structure impact analysis
2. New components require structure review
3. File creation checklist must be followed
4. Structure changes require documentation update

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Export current structure
./scripts/export_structure.py

# Validate file headers
./scripts/validate_headers.py

# Check for duplicates
./scripts/check_duplicates.py
```

## Structure Evolution Tracking
Keep track of structural changes in:
1. `CHANGELOG.md`
2. `architecture.mermaid`
3. `project_structure.yml`
