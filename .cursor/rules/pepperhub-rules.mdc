# .pepper_hub Asset Management Rules

## Overview

This document establishes a **unified local storage strategy** for all AI artifacts (e.g., prompts, agents, workflows, plugins) under a single folder named `.pepper_hub/`.  
By adhering to these rules, teams can easily version, track, and maintain consistency across different types of assets.

---

## 1. Directory Structure

```plaintext
.pepper_hub/
├── prompts/
│   └── (prompt_name)/
│       ├── 1.0.0.yaml
│       └── 1.0.1.yaml
├── agents/
│   └── (agent_name)/
│       ├── 1.0.0.yaml
│       └── 1.1.0.yaml
├── workflows/
│   └── (workflow_name)/
│       ├── 1.0.0.yaml
│       └── 1.0.1.yaml
└── plugins/
    └── (plugin_name)/
        ├── 1.0.0.yaml
        └── 1.0.1.yaml
```

1. **Root Folder**  
   - `.pepper_hub/` serves as the top-level directory for all asset types.

2. **Asset Type Subfolders**  
   - Within `.pepper_hub/`, create subfolders for each major asset category: `prompts/`, `agents/`, `workflows/`, and so on.  
   - Each subfolder contains one or more assets, with each asset having its own dedicated folder.

3. **Versioned Files**  
   - Each asset folder may contain multiple version files (e.g., `1.0.0.yaml`, `1.1.0.yaml`).  
   - Increment version numbers whenever significant changes are made.

---

## 2. Asset File Format

A typical file (YAML/JSON) should include at least the following keys:

```yaml
name: "example_asset"
type: "prompt"  # or agent, workflow, plugin, etc.
version: "1.0.0"
content: |
  # Main body, definitions, configuration, or instructions

# Optional metadata fields
description: "Brief explanation of the asset"
tags: ["example", "demo"]
```

- **name**: Unique identifier for the asset (folder name usually matches this).  
- **type**: The asset category (`prompt`, `agent`, `workflow`, etc.).  
- **version**: Current version of this asset.  
- **content**: Core data or instructions relevant to the asset.  
- **metadata** (optional): Could include fields like `description`, `tags`, `author`, or any other context.

---

## 3. Adding or Updating Assets

1. **Create/Modify a File**  
   - Draft or edit a YAML/JSON file with the required fields (`name`, `type`, `version`, etc.).  
2. **Choose the Correct Folder**  
   - For an agent named `my_agent`, place it under:  
     ```
     .pepper_hub/agents/my_agent/1.0.0.yaml
     ```
3. **Increment Versions**  
   - Upon updating significant content, increment the version (e.g., from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`).  
4. **Maintain Change History**  
   - Older versions remain accessible for reference or rollback.

---

## 4. Retrieval and Listing

- **Listing**  
  - Use a CLI or simply inspect the subfolders to view available artifacts.  
  - Each folder will show the specific asset versions.  
- **Retrieving a Version**  
  - Point to the exact file path for the desired version (e.g., `1.0.1.yaml`).  
  - Alternatively, define a convention for the “latest” version (like sorting by version number or using a `latest.yaml` symlink).

---

## 5. Best Practices

1. **Consistency**  
   - Follow a clear naming convention for both folders and files.  
   - Keep type labels (`prompt`, `agent`, etc.) consistent across all YAML/JSON definitions.

2. **Documentation & Metadata**  
   - Include a `description` and `tags` array to help identify the purpose of each asset.  
   - Provide “example usage” or “expected inputs/outputs” if relevant.

3. **Version Control**  
   - Consider using semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0 → 1.1.0 → 2.0.0`).  
   - Record changes in a changelog or comments within the file.

4. **Testing & Validation**  
   - For complex assets (like prompts or workflows), include sample inputs/outputs or test scenarios.  
   - Validate new versions before replacing existing ones in production or advanced environments.

5. **Scalability**  
   - If subfolders become large, subdivide them by domain or feature (e.g., `prompts/agents/reasoning/`, `agents/assistant/expert/`).  
   - Keep only active or widely used versions accessible, archiving older files as needed.

## 6. Examples

### Example Prompt Asset

```yaml
name: "brainstorm_prompt"
type: "prompt"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "A prompt to encourage creative thinking."
tags: ["brainstorming", "creativity"]
content: |
  Generate five distinct ideas for {{topic}}. 
  Provide each idea as a short paragraph.
```

### Example Agent Asset

```yaml
name: "customer_service_agent"
type: "agent"
version: "1.1.0"
description: "Handles user inquiries with a friendly tone."
tags: ["customer_service", "support"]
content: |
  # Agent configuration details, memory handling, role definitions, etc.
```

### Example Workflow Asset

```yaml
name: "order_processing_workflow"
type: "workflow"
version: "2.0.0"
description: "Multi-step process to validate and fulfill orders."
tags: ["ecommerce", "process"]
content: |
  1. Validate the incoming order data
  2. Check inventory status
  3. Confirm payment processing
  4. Update order status in the system
```

## 7. Maintenance and Monitoring

1. **Periodic Review**  
   - Regularly review the `.pepper_hub/` directory for outdated or unused versions.  
2. **Cleanup**  
   - Delete stale assets or versions to reduce clutter.  
3. **Auditing**  
   - Track usage and changes to understand the evolution and performance of assets over time.
