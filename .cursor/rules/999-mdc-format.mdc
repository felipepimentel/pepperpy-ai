# MDC File Format Guide

MDC (Markdown Configuration) files are used by Cursor to provide context-specific instructions to AI assistants. This guide explains how to create and maintain these files properly.

## File Structure

Each MDC file consists of two main parts:

1. **Frontmatter** - Configuration metadata at the top of the file
2. **Markdown Content** - The actual instructions in Markdown format

### Frontmatter

The frontmatter must be the first thing in the file and must be enclosed between triple-dash lines (`---`). Configuration should be based on the intended behavior:

```
---
# Configure your rule based on desired behavior:

description: Brief description of what the rule does
globs: **/*.js, **/*.ts  # Optional: Comma-separated list, not an array
alwaysApply: false       # Set to true for global rules
---
```

> **Important**: Despite the appearance, the frontmatter is not strictly YAML formatted. The `globs` field is a comma-separated list and should NOT include brackets `[]` or quotes `"`.

#### Guidelines for Setting Fields

- **description**: Should be agent-friendly and clearly describe when the rule is relevant. Format as `<topic>: <details>` for best results.
- **globs**: 
  - If a rule is only relevant in very specific situations, leave globs empty so it's loaded only when applicable to the user request.
  - If the only glob would match all files (like `**/*`), leave it empty and set `alwaysApply: true` instead.
  - Otherwise, be as specific as possible with glob patterns to ensure rules are only applied with relevant files.
- **alwaysApply**: Use sparingly for truly global guidelines.

#### Glob Pattern Examples

- **/*.js - All JavaScript files
- src/**/*.jsx - All JSX files in the src directory
- **/components/**/*.vue - All Vue files in any components directory

### Markdown Content

After the frontmatter, the rest of the file should be valid Markdown:

```markdown
# Title of Your Rule

## Section 1
- Guidelines and information
- Code examples

## Section 2
More detailed information...
```

## Special Features

### File References

You can reference other files from within an MDC file using the markdown link syntax:

```
[rule-name.mdc](mdc:location/of/the/rule.mdc)
```

When this rule is activated, the referenced file will also be included in the context.

### Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks for examples:

````markdown
```javascript
// Example code
function example() {
  return "This is an example";
}
```
````

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Organization**
   - Use numbered prefixes (e.g., `01-workflow.mdc`) for sorting rules logically
   - Place task-specific rules in the `tasks/` subdirectory
   - Use descriptive filenames that indicate the rule's purpose

2. **Frontmatter Specificity**
   - Be specific with glob patterns to ensure rules are only applied in relevant contexts
   - Use `alwaysApply: true` for truly global guidelines
   - Make descriptions clear and concise so AI knows when to apply the rule

3. **Content Structure**
   - Start with a clear title (H1)
   - Use hierarchical headings (H2, H3, etc.) to organize content
   - Include examples where appropriate
   - Keep instructions clear and actionable

4. **File Size Considerations**
   - Keep files focused on a single topic or closely related topics
   - Split very large rule sets into multiple files and link them with references
   - Aim for under 300 lines per file when possible

## Usage in Cursor

When working with files in Cursor, rules are automatically applied when:

1. The file you're working on matches a rule's glob pattern
2. A rule has `alwaysApply: true` set in its frontmatter
3. The agent thinks the rule's description matches the user request
4. You explicitly reference a rule in a conversation with Cursor's AI

## Creating/Renaming/Removing Rules

   - When a rule file is added/renamed/removed, update also the list under 010-workflow.mdc.
   - When changs are made to multiple `mdc` files from a single request, review also [999-mdc-format]((mdc:.cursor/rules/999-mdc-format.mdc)) to consider whether to update it too.

## Updating Rules

When updating existing rules:

1. Maintain the frontmatter format
2. Keep the same glob patterns unless intentionally changing the rule's scope
3. Update the description if the purpose of the rule changes
4. Consider whether changes should propagate to related rules (e.g., CE versions)

## Handling Instruction Changes

When the user indicates changes to existing guidance with statements like "don't do this anymore", "forget this", or "change this approach":

1. **Analyze Existing Rules**:
   - Review all relevant rules that might be affected by the change
   - Determine if the change conflicts with guidance in other rules
   - Identify if the change requires updating multiple rules

2. **Update Approaches**:
   - **Modify Existing Rule**: Update the relevant section in the appropriate rule file when the change refines existing guidance
   - **Create New Rule**: If the change represents a significant shift in approach or applies to a specific domain
   - **Deprecate Content**: When instructions should be removed, either delete the content or mark it as deprecated with clear alternatives

3. **Document Changes**:
   - Add a change note at the affected section
   - Consider adding a versioning comment for significant changes
   - Make sure changes are consistent across related rules

4. **Implementation Examples**:
   - If a practice is being replaced, include:
     - The old pattern marked as ❌ **WRONG**
     - The new pattern marked as ✅ **CORRECT**
     - Brief explanation of why the change was made

5. **Cross-Reference**:
   - When guidance changes in one rule, check for similar guidance in other rules
   - Ensure consistent application of the principle across all relevant files
