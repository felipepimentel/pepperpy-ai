This technical document explains vector embeddings and similarity search.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for implementing efficient retrieval systems.

Vector embeddings represent text as high-dimensional numerical vectors.
Each dimension captures different semantic aspects of the text.
Modern embedding models use transformer architectures for better representation.
Popular models like BERT and GPT have revolutionized text embeddings.

Similarity search algorithms find vectors that are close to a query vector.
Euclidean distance and cosine similarity are common metrics.
Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms make search scalable.
FAISS and Annoy are popular libraries for vector similarity search.

Vector databases optimize storage and retrieval of embeddings.
They support efficient indexing of high-dimensional vectors.
Some databases combine vector search with traditional text search.
This hybrid approach often yields better search results.
