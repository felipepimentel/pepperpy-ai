# Requirement Description
Implement core system integration to establish a unified foundation for all system components.

## Objectives
1. Create a centralized integration layer
2. Establish standardized communication protocols
3. Implement service discovery mechanism
4. Define system boundaries and interfaces
5. Set up error handling and recovery procedures

## Technical Specifications

### Integration Layer
