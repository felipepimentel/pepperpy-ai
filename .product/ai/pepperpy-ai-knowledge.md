# Pepperpy AI Knowledge Base

## Overview

Pepperpy is a modular framework for building AI agents, focused on research and information processing. The project provides a flexible and powerful structure to create, manage, and deploy AI agents with emphasis on research capabilities.

### Core Principles

1. **Modularity**
   - Independent and reusable components
   - Clear and well-defined interfaces
   - Easy extension and customization

2. **Flexibility**
   - Support for multiple AI providers
   - Adaptable to different use cases
   - Configurable for different needs

3. **Reliability**
   - Robust error handling
   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Multi-level validation

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System
The agent system is responsible for:
- Agent lifecycle management
- Capability coordination
- Request processing
- State management

### 2. Provider System
The provider system:
- Integrates different AI services
- Manages credentials and resources
- Optimizes resource usage
- Provides consistent abstractions

### 3. Memory System
The memory system:
- Manages conversation history
- Maintains context between interactions
- Optimizes resource usage
- Provides persistence when needed

### 4. Hub System
The hub system:
- Centralizes AI resources
- Manages asset versions
- Facilitates sharing
- Maintains consistency

## Asset Management (.pepper_hub)
