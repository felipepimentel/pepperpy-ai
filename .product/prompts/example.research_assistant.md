**YOLO = true**

1. **Run the file** `@research_assistant.py` using the command:  
   `poetry run python examples/research_assistant.py`  
   (You may repeat this step as needed to resolve any issues.)

2. **Environment Variables:**  
   - **Do not** modify any existing `.env` file keys or values, especially  
     `PEPPERPY_API_KEY`, `PEPPERPY_PROVIDER`, and `PEPPERPY_MODEL`.

3. **Handle Errors and Warnings:**  
   - If errors or warnings occur, fix them following **best practices**, while respecting the **existing project structure** from `.product/project_structure.yml`.  
   - Changes may be made in **either** the example code **or** the library itself—whichever is most appropriate—without creating duplicate files.  
   - Always ensure the library remains **flexible**, **high-quality**, and **easy to use**.

4. **Verify Logs:**  
   - After a successful execution, check that **all log outputs** match the configurations specified in the `.env` file.

5. **Minimize Cognitive Load:**  
   - Keep the solution as **straightforward** as possible to ensure **ease of use** for end-users.

6. **Final Output:**  
   - If everything runs successfully without requiring any changes, simply confirm that the process was successful.  
   - If modifications were necessary to fix issues, provide the **updated code** (in English) confirming it is now fully functional.
