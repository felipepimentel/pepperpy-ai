        Query: What do we know about the user's preferred programming style?
        
        Memory Fragments:
        [1] User consistently uses type hints and docstrings (2024-03-15)
        [2] Preference for functional programming patterns noted (2024-03-14)
        [3] User requested modular code organization (2024-03-13)
      output: |
        Based on the available memory:
        1. The user follows a strict typing discipline, consistently using type hints [1]
        2. They prefer functional programming patterns over imperative approaches [2]
        3. Code organization is important to them, with a focus on modularity [3]
        
        This suggests a preference for a modern, type-safe, and functional programming style
        with clean architecture principles.
