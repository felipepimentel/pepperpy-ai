"""Specialized metric collectors for different subsystems.

This module provides specialized metric collectors for different parts of the system:
- System metrics collectors for hardware and OS-level metrics
- Application metrics collectors for application-specific metrics
- Performance metrics collectors for tracking performance data
- Custom collectors for domain-specific metrics

These collectors extend the base MetricsCollector functionality with specialized
collection, aggregation, and reporting capabilities for different metric types
and sources.
