"""Health monitoring for PepperPy.

This module provides health monitoring capabilities for the PepperPy framework:
- Health checks: Verify the health of system components
- Status reporting: Report system status to external systems
- Readiness probes: Determine if the system is ready to accept requests
- Liveness probes: Determine if the system is alive and functioning

The health monitoring system enables applications to report their health status
and allows infrastructure to make decisions based on that status.
