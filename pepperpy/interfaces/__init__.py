"""PepperPy Interfaces Module.

This module provides protocol and interface definitions for the PepperPy framework, including:
- Base protocols for common patterns
- Resource management protocols
- Design pattern protocols
- Data management protocols
- Service management protocols

The interfaces module is designed to define the contracts that components in the
framework must adhere to, enabling loose coupling and dependency injection.
