"""Vector database providers for RAG retrieval.

This module contains implementations of vector database providers for the Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) system, enabling efficient semantic search and retrieval
of document embeddings from various vector database backends.

Vector databases are specialized storage systems optimized for similarity search
operations on high-dimensional vectors, which are essential for semantic retrieval
in RAG workflows.
