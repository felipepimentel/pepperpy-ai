# Consolidated Cursor Rules

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
- Use `black` for code formatting with a line length of 88.
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return types.
- Prefer `async`/`await` for I/O operations.
- Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Documentation

- All public APIs must have docstrings.
- Use Google-style docstring format.
- Include type hints in docstrings.
- Provide usage examples for complex functions.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features.
- Maintain test coverage above 80%.
- Use `pytest` for testing.
- Write async tests using `pytest-asyncio`.
- Mock external dependencies.

## Security

- Never store sensitive data in code.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Follow secure coding practices.
- Validate all inputs and sanitize where appropriate.
- Handle errors gracefully.

## Dependencies

- Use Poetry for dependency management.
- Pin dependency versions.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date.
- Separate optional dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.

## Git Workflow

- Use semantic versioning.
- Write descriptive commit messages following the conventional commits specification.
- Create feature branches for new features.
- Submit PRs for review.

## Error Handling

- Define custom exceptions in `exceptions.py`.
- Include context in error messages.
- Log errors appropriately with structured logging.
- Handle edge cases explicitly.

## Performance

- Use async operations where appropriate.
- Implement caching for expensive operations.
- Monitor and profile code for bottlenecks.
- Optimize resource usage and implement proper cleanup.

## Code Organization

- Keep modules focused and single-purpose.
- Follow modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Use dependency injection and adhere to SOLID principles.
- Avoid circular dependencies.

## Quality Checks

- Run `mypy` for type checking.
- Use `ruff` for linting.
- Run `bandit` for security checks.
- Maintain clean build status.

## AI Assistant Rules

- Prefer async implementations.
- Use type hints consistently.
- Follow project structure.
- Implement proper error handling.
- Add comprehensive docstrings with examples.
- Write unit tests.
- Consider security implications.
- Optimize for performance.
- Keep code modular.

## Documentation Updates

- Evaluate if changes necessitate updates to the `/docs` directory.
- Ensure all relevant documentation is updated and improved as needed.

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Use structured logging with context information.
- Implement proper log levels and telemetry for performance metrics.
- Track error rates and monitor for anomalies.

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews

- Ensure all pull requests include test coverage.
- Verify documentation updates are included.
- Check type consistency and error handling.
- Ensure adherence to conventional commits.
