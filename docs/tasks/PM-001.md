# Task: Intelligent Project Manager Implementation

## Context
The project needs an automated system to manage, prioritize, and track tasks effectively. This system will leverage AI capabilities to analyze project context, maintain task dependencies, and ensure proper documentation of progress.

## Description
Implement an AI-powered project management system that will:
- Analyze and maintain project status documentation
- Dynamically prioritize tasks based on dependencies and progress
- Generate and update task documentation
- Track progress and blockers across the project

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement automated status.md file parsing and updating
- [ ] Create task file generation system following template structure
- [ ] Develop priority calculation algorithm based on dependencies and blockers
- [ ] Implement automated task progress tracking
- [ ] Add documentation generation for new tasks and updates
- [ ] Achieve >90% test coverage for all components
- [ ] Create comprehensive usage documentation

## Steps to Completion
1. Implement status file parser and validator
2. Create task file generator and updater
3. Develop priority calculation system
4. Implement progress tracking mechanism
5. Add automated documentation generation
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Create user documentation

## Progress Logs
- **2024-03-19 10:00:00**: Initial task created, scope defined
- **2024-03-19 10:30:00**: Started implementation of status file parser

## Notes
- Integration with existing agent system will be crucial for AI-powered analysis
- Consider implementing caching for performance optimization
- May need to add new endpoints to the API for task management
