# TASK-014-R002: Fix Linter Errors and Complete Documentation Migration

## Context
As part of TASK-014 (Migration to Unified Pipeline Framework), we've updated the documentation in several modules to follow Google-style format. However, some linter errors remain that need to be addressed.

## Requirements
1. Fix linter errors in `pepperpy/core/utils.py`:
   - Type compatibility issues with `Type[Any]` parameters in `validate_dict` and `validate_list` functions
   - Consider using more specific type parameters or a different approach to type validation

2. Fix linter errors in `pepperpy/data/transform.py`:
   - Remove references to non-existent `name` attribute in error handling
   - Fix function signature mismatches in `TextTransform` and `DataTransform` classes
   - Consider adding proper error context without relying on pipeline name

3. Complete documentation updates:
   - Review and update any remaining docstrings that don't follow Google-style format
   - Ensure all functions have proper Args, Returns, and Raises sections
   - Add migration notes where appropriate
   - Update examples to reflect the new unified pipeline framework

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All linter errors are resolved in both files
2. Documentation follows Google-style format consistently
3. All examples are up-to-date and working
4. No regressions in functionality
5. Tests pass without errors

## Implementation Notes
1. For `pepperpy/core/utils.py`:
   - Consider using `TypeVar` with bounds for type validation
   - Look into using `typing.cast` where appropriate
   - Consider splitting type validation into separate functions for different types

2. For `pepperpy/data/transform.py`:
   - Remove dependency on pipeline name in error handling
   - Update error messages to be more descriptive
   - Consider adding stage information to error context
   - Review function signatures for consistency

3. Documentation:
   - Use doctest-compatible examples
   - Include both success and error cases in examples
   - Add migration notes where backward compatibility is maintained
   - Document any breaking changes
